	Abstract = {Markov decision process (MDP) models are widely used for modeling sequential decision-making problems that arise in engineering, economics, computer science, and the social sciences. It is well-known that many real-world problems modeled by MDPs have huge state and/or action spaces, leading to the notorious curse of dimensionality that makes practical solution of the resulting models intractable. In other cases, the system of interest is complex enough that it is not feasible to specify some of the MDP model parameters explicitly, but simulation samples are readily available (e.g., for random transitions and costs). For these settings, various sampling and population-based numerical algorithms have been developed recently to overcome the difficulties of computing an optimal solution in terms of a policy and/or value function. Specific approaches include:
* multi-stage adaptive sampling;
* evolutionary policy iteration;
* evolutionary random policy search; and
* model reference adaptive search.
Simulation-based Algorithms for Markov Decision Processes brings this state-of-the-art research together for the first time and presents it in a manner that makes it accessible to researchers with varying interests and backgrounds. In addition to providing numerous specific algorithms, the exposition includes both illustrative numerical examples and rigorous theoretical convergence results. The algorithms developed and analyzed differ from the successful computational methods for solving MDPs based on neuro-dynamic programming or reinforcement learning and will complement work in those areas. Furthermore, the authors show how to combine the various algorithms introduced with approximate dynamic programming methods that reduce the size of the state space and ameliorate the effects of dimensionality.
The self-contained approach of this book will appeal not only to researchers in MDPs, stochastic modeling and control, and simulation but will be a valuable source of instruction and reference for students of control and operations research.},

	Abstract = {Options are important instruments in modern finance. In this paper, we investigate reinforcement learning (RL) methods---in particular, least-squares policy iteration (LSPI)---for the problem of learning exercise policies for American options. We develop finite-time bounds on the performance of the policy obtained with LSPI and compare LSPI and the fitted Q-iteration algorithm (FQI) with the Longstaff-Schwartz method (LSM), the standard least-squares Monte Carlo algorithm from the finance community. Our empirical results show that the exercise policies discovered by LSPI and FQI gain larger payoffs than those discovered by LSM, on both real and synthetic data. Furthermore, we find that for all methods the policies learned from real data generally gain similar payoffs to the policies learned from simulated data. Our work shows that solution methods developed in machine learning can advance the state-of-the-art in an important and challenging application area, while demonstrating that computational finance remains a promising area for future applications of machine learning methods.},

	Abstract = {Reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm concerned with learning to control a system so as to maximize a numerical performance measure that expresses a long-term objective. What distinguishes reinforcement learning from supervised learning is that only partial feedback is given to the learner about the learner's predictions. Further, the predictions may have long term effects through influencing the future state of the controlled system. Thus, time plays a special role. The goal in reinforcement learning is to develop efficient learning algorithms, as well as to understand the algorithms' merits and limitations. Reinforcement learning is of great interest because of the large number of practical applications that it can be used to address, ranging from problems in artificial intelligence to operations research or control engineering. In this book we focus on those algorithms of reinforcement learning which build on the powerful theory of dynamic programming. We give a fairly comprehensive catalog of learning problems, describe the core ideas, a large number of state of the art algorithms, followed by the discussion of their theoretical properties and limitations.},

@article{LeSzeZh14,
	Abstract = {We consider the problem of optimally assigning p sniffers to K channels to
monitor the transmission activities in a multi-channel wireless network with
switching costs. The activity of users is initially unknown to the sniffers and
is to be learned along with channel assignment decisions to maximize the
benefits of this assignment, resulting in the fundamental trade-off between
exploration and exploitation. Switching costs are incurred when sniffers change
their channel assignments. As a result, frequent changes are undesirable. We
formulate the sniffer-channel assignment with switching costs as a linear
partial monitoring problem, a super-class of multi-armed bandits. As the number
of arms (sniffer-channel assignments) is exponential, novel techniques are
called for, to allow efficient learning.  We use the linear bandit model to
capture the dependency amongst the arms and develop a policy that takes
advantage of this dependency. We prove the proposed Upper Confident Bound-based
(UCB) policy enjoys a logarithmic regret bound in time t that depends
sub-linearly on the number of arms, while its total switching cost grows with log(log(t)).},

	Abstract = {In this paper we consider approximate policy-iteration-based reinforcement learning algorithms. In order to implement a flexible function approximation scheme we propose the use of non-parametric methods with regularization, providing a convenient way to control the complexity of the function approximator. We propose two novel regularized policy iteration algorithms by adding L2-regularization to two widely-used policy evaluation methods: Bellman residual minimization (BRM) and least-squares temporal difference learning (LSTD). We derive efficient implementation for our algorithms when the approximate value-functions belong to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We also provide finite-sample performance bounds for our algorithms and show that they are able to achieve optimal rates of convergence under the studied conditions.},

@article{audibert2009,
	Abstract = {Algorithms based on upper confidence bounds for balancing exploration and exploitation are gaining popularity since they are easy to implement, efficient and effective. This paper considers a variant of the basic algorithm for the stochastic, multi-armed bandit problem that takes into account the empirical variance of the different arms. In earlier experimental works, such algorithms were found to outperform the competing algorithms. We provide the first analysis of the expected regret for such algorithms. As expected, our results show that the algorithm that uses the variance estimates has a major advantage over its alternatives that do not use such estimates provided that the variances of the payoffs of the suboptimal arms are low. We also prove that the regret concentrates only at a polynomial rate. This holds for all the upper confidence bound based algorithms and for all bandit problems except those special ones where with probability one the payoff obtained by pulling the optimal arm is larger than the expected payoff for the second best arm. Hence, although upper confidence bound bandit algorithms achieve logarithmic expected regret rates, they might not be suitable for a risk-averse decision maker. We illustrate some of the results by computer simulations.},

Three cases are treated: stationary (or essentially stationary) weakly dependent data, weakly dependent data containing deterministic trends, and nonergodic data (or data with stochastic trends). Estimation of asymptotic covariance matrices and computation of the major test statistics are covered. Examples include multivariate least squares estimation of a dynamic conditional mean, quasi-maximum likelihood estimation of a jointly parameterized conditional mean and conditional variance, and generalized method of moments estimation of orthogonality conditions. Some results for linear models with integrated variables are provided, as are some abstract limiting distribution results for nonlinear models with trending data.},

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of sequentially choosing between a set of
unbiased Monte Carlo estimators to minimize the mean-squared-error (MSE) of a
final combined estimate. 
By reducing this task to a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem,
we show that well developed allocation strategies can be used to achieve 
an MSE that approaches that of the best estimator chosen in retrospect.
We then extend these developments to a scenario where alternative estimators 
have different, possibly stochastic costs.
The outcome is a new set of adaptive Monte Carlo strategies that provide stronger
guarantees than previous approaches while offering practical advantages.

	Abstract = {We study the problem of online learning Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs) when both the transition distributions and loss functions
are chosen by an adversary. We present an algorithm that, under a
mixing assumption, achieves \sqrt{T\log|\Pi|}+\log|\Pi| regret
with respect to a comparison set of policies \Pi.  The regret
is independent of the size of the state and action spaces. When
expectations over sample paths can be computed efficiently and
the comparison set \Pi has polynomial size,
this algorithm is efficient.

We also consider the episodic adversarial online shortest path
problem.  Here, in each episode an adversary may choose a weighted
directed acyclic graph with an identified start and finish node. The
goal of the learning algorithm is to choose a path that minimizes
the loss while traversing from the start to finish node. At the end
of each episode the loss function (given by weights on the edges)
is revealed to the learning algorithm. The goal is to minimize regret
with respect to a fixed policy for selecting paths. This problem is
a special case of the online MDP problem. 
It was shown that for randomly chosen graphs
and adversarial losses, the problem can be efficiently solved. We
show that it also can be efficiently solved for adversarial
graphs and randomly chosen losses.  When both graphs and losses
are adversarially chosen, we show that designing efficient algorithms for the
adversarial online shortest path problem (and hence for the
adversarial MDP problem) is as hard as learning parity with noise, a
notoriously difficult problem that has been used to design efficient
cryptographic schemes. Finally, we present an efficient algorithm whose
regret scales linearly with the number of distinct graphs.

	Abstract = { In a partial monitoring game, the learner repeatedly chooses an action, the
environment responds with an outcome, and then the learner suffers a loss and
receives a feedback signal, both of which are fixed functions of the action and
the outcome. The goal of the learner is to minimize his regret, which is the
difference between his total cumulative loss and the total loss of the best
fixed action in hindsight.
In this paper we characterize the minimax regret of any
partial monitoring game with finitely many actions and
outcomes. It turns out that the minimax regret of any such game is either zero,
Theta~(T^{1/2}), Theta(T^{2/3}), or Theta(T).  We provide computationally efficient learning
algorithms that achieve the minimax regret within logarithmic factor for any game. In addition to the bounds on the minimax regret, if we assume that the outcomes are generated in an i.i.d. fashion, we prove individual upper bounds on the expected regret.},

We propose to view this problem as an instance of online linear optimization.  We propose two methods for this problem: MD^2 (mirror descent with approximate projections) and the continuous exponential weights algorithm with Dikin walks.  We provide a rigorous complexity analysis of these techniques, while providing near-optimal regret-bounds (in particular, we take into account the computational costs of performing approximate projections in MD^2).  In the case of full-information feedback, our results complement existing ones. In the case of bandit-information feedback we consider the online stochastic shortest path problem, a special case of the above MDP problems, and manage to improve the existing results by removing the previous restrictive assumption that the state-visitation probabilities are uniformly bounded away from zero under all policies.},

At each time-step the manager should distribute available resources among the jobs in order to maximise the expected number of completed jobs.

Specifically, we assume a linear
model where the probability increases linearly until it equals one, after which
allocating additional resources is wasteful.
We assume the difficulty of each job is unknown

We first consider the single-state, or multi-armed bandit case, establish a finite-time minimax risk lower bound, and analyze the risk of three standard estimators.  
For the so-called regression estimator, we show that while it is asymptotically optimal, for small sample sizes it may perform suboptimally compared to an ideal oracle up to a multiplicative factor that depends on the number of actions.
We also show that the other two popular estimators can be arbitrarily worse than the optimal, even in the limit of infinitely many data points. 
The performance of the estimators are studied in synthetic and real problems; illustrating the methods strengths and weaknesses.
We also discuss the implications of these results  for off-policy evaluation problems in contextual bandits and fixed-horizon Markov decision processes.

Pseudo-MDPs relax the requirement that the transition kernel has to be a probability kernel.
We show that the new framework captures many existing abstractions.
We also introduce the concept of factored linear action models; a special case.
Again, the relation of factored linear action models and existing works are discussed.
We use the general framework to develop a theory for bounding the suboptimality of policies derived from pseudo-MDPs.
Specializing the framework, we recover existing results.
We give a least-squares approach and a constrained optimization approach of learning the factored linear model as well as efficient computation methods. 
We demonstrate that the constrained optimization approach gives better performance than the least-squares approach with normalization.

	Abstract = {A popular approach in reinforcement learning is to use a model-based algorithm, i.e., an algorithm that utilizes a model learner to learn an approximate model to the environment. It has been shown such a model-based learner is efficient if the model learner is efficient in the so-called ``knows what it knows'' (KWIK) framework. A major limitation of the standard KWIK framework is that, by its very definition, it covers only the case when the (model) learner can represent the actual environment with no errors. In this paper, we introduce the agnostic KWIK learning model, where we relax this assumption by allowing nonzero approximation errors. We show that with the new definition that an efficient model learner still leads to an efficient reinforcement learning algorithm. At the same time, though, we find that learning within the new framework can be substantially slower as compared to the standard framework, even in the case of simple learning problems.},

	Abstract = {Online learning with delayed feedback has received increasing attention recently due to its several applications in distributed, web-based learning problems. In this paper we provide a systematic study of the topic, and analyze how the delay effects the regret of online learning algorithms. Somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that delay increases the regret in a multiplicative way in adversarial problems, and in an additive way in stochastic problems. We give meta-algorithms that transform, in a black-box fashion, algorithms developed for the non-delayed case into ones that can handle the presence of delays in the feedback loop. Modifications of the well-known UCB algorithm are also developed for the bandit problem with delayed feedback, with the advantage over the meta-algorithms that they can be implemented with much lower complexity.},

	Abstract = {The ancient oriental game of Go has long been considered a grand challenge for artificial intelligence. For decades, computer Go has defied the classical methods in game tree search that worked so successfully for chess and checkers. How- ever, recent play in computer Go has been transformed by a new paradigm for tree search based on Monte-Carlo methods. Programs based on Monte-Carlo tree search now play at human-master levels and are beginning to challenge top professional players. In this paper we describe the leading algorithms for Monte-Carlo tree search and explain how they have advanced the state of the art in computer Go.},

Focusing on a particular co- variate shift problem, we derive high probability confidence bounds for the kernel mean matching (KMM) estimator, whose convergence rate turns out to depend on some regularity measure of the regression function and also on some capacity measure of the kernel. By comparing KMM with the natural plug-in estimator, we establish the superiority of the former hence provide concrete evidence/understanding to the effectiveness of KMM under covariate shift.},

	Abstract = {(This version is identical to the MLJ version except that in the proof of Theorem 2 a minor issue in the proof is corrected.) We consider the problem of model selection in the batch (offline, non-interactive) rein- forcement learning setting when the goal is to find an action-value function with the smallest Bellman error among a countable set of candidates functions. We propose a complexity regularization-based model selection algorithm, BErMin, and prove that it enjoys an oracle-like property: the estimator's error differs from that of an oracle, who selects the candidate with the minimum Bell- man error, by only a constant factor and a small remainder term that vanishes at a parametric rate as the number of samples increases. As an application, we consider a problem when the true action-value function belongs to an unknown member of a nested sequence of function spaces. We show that under some additional technical conditions BErMin leads to a procedure whose rate of convergence, up to a constant factor, matches that of an oracle who knows which of the nested function spaces the true action-value function belongs to, i.e., the procedure achieves adaptivity.},

iteration of the Approximate Policy/Value Iteration algorithms influences the quality
of the resulted policy. We quantify the performance loss as the L^p norm of the
approximation error/Bellman residual at each iteration. Moreover, we show that
the performance loss depends on the expectation of the squared Radon-Nikodym
derivative of a certain distribution rather than its supremum -- as opposed to what
has been suggested by the previous results. Also our results indicate that the
contribution of the approximation/Bellman error to the performance loss is more
prominent in the later iterations of API/AVI, and the effect of an error term in the
earlier iterations decays exponentially fast.},

	Abstract = {The success of kernel-based learning methods depends on the choice of kernel. Recently, kernel learning methods have been proposed that use data to select the most appropriate kernel, usually by combining a set of base kernels. We introduce a new algorithm for kernel learning that combines a continuous set of base kernels, without the common step of discretizing the space of base kernels. We demonstrate that our new method achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of real-world datasets. Furthermore, we explicitly demonstrate the importance of combining the right dictionary of kernels, which is problematic for methods that combine a finite set of base kernels chosen a priori. Our method is not the first approach to work with continuously parameterized kernels. We adopt a two-stage kernel learning approach. We also show that our method requires substantially less computation than previous such approaches, and so is more amenable to multi-dimensional parameterizations of base kernels, which we demonstrate.},

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of simultaneously learning to linearly combine a very large number of kernels and learn a good predictor based on the learnt kernel.
When the number of kernels d to be combined is very large, multiple kernel learning methods whose computational cost scales linearly in d are intractable.
We propose a randomized version of the mirror descent algorithm to overcome this issue, under the objective of minimizing the group p-norm penalized empirical risk. The key to achieve the required exponential speed-up  is the computationally efficient construction of low-variance estimates of the gradient.
We propose importance sampling based estimates, and find that the ideal distribution samples a coordinate with a probability proportional to the magnitude of the corresponding gradient. We show the surprising result that in the case of learning the coefficients of a polynomial kernel, the combinatorial structure of the base kernels to be combined allows the implementation of sampling from this distribution to run in O(log(d)) time, making the total computational cost of the method to achieve an epsilon-optimal solution to be O(log(d)/epsilon^2), thereby allowing our method to operate for very large values of d. Experiments with simulated and real data confirm that the new algorithm is computationally more efficient than its state-of-the-art alternatives.},

We propose a new approach for constructing a multi-level hierarchy of progressively simpler abstractions of the original problem. Once computed, the hierarchy can be used to speed up planning by first finding a policy for the most abstract level and then recursively refining it into a solution to the original problem. This approach is fully automated and delivers a speed-up of two orders of magnitude over a state-of-the-art MDP solver on sample problems while returning near-optimal solutions.},

We consider penalized estimators, where performance is evaluated using a matrix-weighted two-norm of the defect of the estimator measured with respect to the true, unknown coefficients. Two objective functions are considered de- pending whether the error of the defect measured with respect to the noisy coefficients is squared or unsquared. We propose simple, yet novel and theoretically well-founded data-dependent choices for the regularization parameters for both cases that avoid data-splitting. A distinguishing feature of our analysis is that we derive deterministic error bounds in terms of the error of the coefficients, thus allowing the complete separation of the analysis of the stochastic properties of these errors.

We also show that calculating the values of the resulting expression is as easy as calculating these values for binary classification, and derive that some well-known losses share the same rate of convergence as their ``truncated versions'', a fact previously observed only through examples and for some of these losses.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a novel technique, which we call online-to-confidence-set conversion. The technique allows us to construct high-probability confidence sets for linear prediction with correlated inputs given the predictions of any algorithm (e.g., online LASSO, exponentiated gradient algorithm, online least-squares, p-norm algorithm) targeting online learning with linear predictors and the quadratic loss. By construction, the size of the confidence set is directly governed by the regret of the online learning algorithm. Constructing tight confidence sets is interesting on its own, but the new technique is given extra weight by the fact having access tight confidence sets underlies a number of important problems. The advantage of our construction here is that progress in constructing better algorithms for online prediction problems directly translates into tighter confidence sets. In this paper, this is demonstrated in the case of linear stochastic bandits. In particular, we introduce the sparse variant of linear stochastic bandits and show that a recent online algorithm together with our online-to-confidence-set conversion allows one to derive algorithms that can exploit if the reward is a function of a sparse linear combination of the components of the chosen action.},

In particular, we introduce a novel assumption that is complementary to the previous smoothness conditions, while at the same time smoothness of the mean payoff function is required only at the maxima. Under these new assumptions new bounds on the expected regret are derived. In particular, we show that apart from logarithmic factors, the expected regret scales with the square-root of the number of trials, provided that the mean payoff function has finitely many maxima and its second derivatives are continuous and non-vanishing at the maxima. This improves a previous result of Cope by weakening the assumptions on the function. We also derive matching lower bounds. To complement the bounds on the expected regret, we provide high probability bounds which exhibit similar scaling.},

For these bandits, we propose a new algorithm, called GLM-UCB. 
We derive finite time, high probability bounds on the regret of the algorithm, extending previous analyses developed for the linear bandits to the non-linear case.
  The analysis highlights a key difficulty in generalizing linear bandit algorithms to the non-linear case, which is
  solved in GLM-UCB by focusing on the reward space rather than on the parameter space. 
  Moreover,
  as the actual effectiveness of current parameterized bandit algorithms is often poor
  in practice, we provide a tuning method based on asymptotic arguments,
  which leads to significantly better practical performance.
 We present two numerical experiments on real-world data that
  illustrate the potential of the GLM-UCB approach.

	Abstract = {We consider a generalization of stochastic bandits where the set of
arms, X, is allowed to be a generic measurable space and the
mean-payoff function is "locally Lipschitz" with respect to a
dissimilarity function that is known to the decision maker. Under this
condition we construct an arm selection policy, called HOO
(hierarchical optimistic optimization), with improved regret bounds
compared to previous results for a large class of problems. In
particular, our results imply that if X is the unit hypercube in a
Euclidean space and the mean-payoff function has a finite number of
global maxima around which the behavior of the function is locally
continuous with a known smoothness degree, then the expected regret of
HOO is bounded up to a logarithmic factor by √n, that is, the rate of
growth of the regret is independent of the dimension of the space. We
also prove the minimax optimality of our algorithm when the
dissimilarity is a metric. Our basic strategy has quadratic
computational complexity as a function of the number of time steps and
does not rely on the doubling trick. We also introduce a modified
strategy, which relies on the doubling trick but runs in linearithmic
time. Both results are improvements with respect to previous
approaches.},

Most importantly, the algorithm is adaptive in the sense that if the opponent strategy is in an "easy region" of the strategy space then the regret grows as if the problem was easy.

	Abstract = {If one possesses a model of a controlled deterministic system, then from any state, one may consider the set of all possible reachable states starting from that state and using any sequence of actions. This forms a tree whose size is exponential in the planning time horizon. Here we ask the question: given finite computational resources (e.g. CPU time), which may not be known ahead of time, what is the best way to explore this tree, such that once all resources have been used, the algorithm would be able to propose an action (or a sequence of actions) whose performance is as close as possible to optimality? The performance with respect to optimality is assessed in terms of the regret (with respect to the sum of discounted future rewards) resulting from choosing the action returned by the algorithm instead of an optimal action. In this paper we investigate an optimistic exploration of the tree, where the most promising states are explored first, and compare this approach to a naive uniform exploration. Bounds on the regret are derived both for uniform and optimistic exploration strategies. Numerical simulations illustrate the benefit of optimistic planning.},

The results are proven under the assumption that the metric entropy of the balls in the chosen function space grows at most polynomially. In order to prove our main result, we also derive a relative deviation concentration inequality for beta-mixing processes, which might be of independent interest.  The other major techniques that we use are the independent-blocks technique and the peeling device.  An interesting aspect of our analysis is that in order to obtain fast rates we have to make the block sizes dependent on the layer of peeling. With this approach, up to a logarithmic factor, we recover the optimal minimax rates available for the i.i.d. case. In particular, our rate asymptotically matches  the optimal rate of convergence when the regression function belongs to a Sobolev space.},

However, they can be very inefficient when the observation noise is low as compared to the system noise, as it is often the case in visual tracking applications. In this paper we propose a new two-stage sampling procedure to boost the performance of particle filters under this condition. The new procedure is shown to reduce the variance of the weights by means of a theoretical analysis. This result is confirmed in a series of synthetic and real-world visual tracking experiments.},

	Abstract = {We consider a stochastic extension of the loop-free shortest path problem with adversarial rewards. In this episodic Markov decision problem an agent traverses through an acyclic graph with random transitions: at each step of an episode the agent chooses an action, receives some reward, and arrives at a random next state, where the reward and the distribution of the next state depend on the actual state and the chosen action. We consider the bandit situation when only the reward of the just visited state-action pair is revealed to the agent. For this problem we develop algorithms that perform asymptotically as well as the best stationary policy in hindsight. Assuming that all states are reachable with probability $\alpha > 0$ under all policies, we give an algorithm and prove that its regret is $O(L^2 \sqrt(T|A|)/\alpha)$, where $T$ is the number of episodes, $A$ denotes the (finite) set of actions, and $L$ is the length of the longest path in the graph. Variants of the algorithm are given that improve the dependence on the transition probabilities under specific conditions. The results are also extended to variations of the problem, including the case when the agent competes with time varying policies.},

	Abstract = {We consider online learning in finite stochastic Markovian environments
where in each time step a new reward function is chosen by an oblivious adversary.
The goal of the learning agent is to compete with the best stationary policy
in terms of the total reward received.
In each time step the agent observes the current state and the reward associated with the last transition, however, the agent does not observe the rewards associated with other state-action pairs.
The agent is assumed to know the transition probabilities.
The state of the art result for this setting is a no-regret algorithm.
In this paper we propose a new learning algorithm and,
 assuming that stationary policies mix uniformly fast,
we show that after T time steps, the expected regret of the new algorithm 
is O( T^{2/3} (ln T)^(1/3), 
giving the first rigorously proved regret bound for the problem.

	Abstract = {{This study presents a new procedure to automatically select a discriminant motor task for an asynchronous brain-controlled button. This type of control pertains to Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). When using sensorimotor rythms in a BCI, several motor tasks, such as moving the right or left hand, the feet or the tongue, can be considered as candidates for the control. This report presents a method to select as fast as possible the most promising task. We develop for this purpose an adaptive algorithm UCB-classif based on the stochastic bandit theory and build an EEG experiment to test our method. By not wasting time on ineffi cient tasks, our algorithm can focus on the most promising ones, resulting in a faster task selection and a more e cient use of the BCI training session. This leads to better classi cation rates for a xed time budget, compared to a standard task selection.}},

	Abstract = {We consider linear fixed point equations and their approximations by projection on a low dimensional subspace. We derive new bounds on the approximation error of the solution, which are expressed in terms of low dimensional matrices and can be computed by simulation. When the fixed point mapping is a contraction, as is typically the case in Markov decision processes (MDP), one of our bounds is always sharper than the standard contraction-based bounds, and another one is often sharper. The former bound is also tight in a worst-case sense. Our bounds also apply to the noncontraction case, including policy evaluation in MDP with nonstandard projections that enhance exploration. There are no error bounds currently available for this case to our knowledge.},

The superiority of our algorithm over alternative SLAM algorithms is demonstrated in a difficult loop closing situation.},

Optimization and simulation are two very important techniques of operations research. A book integrating them has a good chance of attracting the attention of operations researchers. In the preface (p. xxv), to Simulation-Based Optimization, Gosavi writes, "If you are working on a problem that involves a stochastic system, and if the problem is one of optimization, you are likely to find a useful material here." The subject of the book is optimization of stochastic objective functions. In practical applications, one normally obtains the values of such functions with Monte-Carlo simulation. Gosavi calls this topic simulation-based optimization. He promises: "... to introduce the reader to the newly emerging and exiting topic of simulation-based optimization" (preface, p. xxv). Indeed, it is an exiting topic, but is it newly emerging? The classical paper on this topic, by Kiefer and Wolfowitz, is dated 1952. Methods of optimization of noisy functions have been intensively investigated for 50 years and have been covered in many publications (Chen 2002). A rich literature exists on this topic in Russian (Ermoljev 1976, Rastrigin 1968). Possibly, by "newly emerging," the author is simply emphasizing new practical applications. But they are not a breakthrough since stochastic optimization typifies the synergy between mathematical theory and applications, for example, in signal processing and design of adaptive control systems (Chen 2002, Tsypkin 1971).

Gosavi begins with some definitions and elementary probability theory. He introduces the basic concepts of simulation, response surfaces, and artificial neural networks. He devotes a chapter (about 40 pages) to parametric optimization, with continuous optimization represented by the gradient-descent method and the Nelder-Mead method. Although the book is oriented toward stochastic optimization, the simultaneous perturbation method is the only method suitable for stochastic optimization covered in this chapter. For simulation-based optimization problems, one can seldom prove the unimodality of an objective function. Therefore, global minimization of noisy functions is important in various applications (Torn and Zilinskas 1989), but Gosavi does not discuss this problem. His presentation of discrete optimization methods is more complete. He describes two selection methods, Rinott and Kim-Nelson, and several metaheuristic search methods (simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, tabu search, and learning automata search). Chapter 11 (about 30 pages) is "Convergence: Background material." Gosavi introduces elementary definitions and concepts, for example, he defines a vector space and convergence conditions for sequences. In the first half of Chapter 12, "Convergence analysis of parametric optimization methods," he defines continuous functions, Taylor's theorem, the necessary conditions of unconstrained minimum. In the second half, he proves the convergence of the gradient descent method and the convergence of the simultaneous perturbation method and discusses simulated annealing.

Gosavi devotes most of the book to special problems of optimal stochastic control. He introduces the concept of a Markov chain and considers an optimal deterministic stationary decision related to the Markov chain. The optimal decision consists...},

The second method directly uses samples coming from the robot without building any intermediate model (model-free RL).

In this paper, we investigate reinforcement learning (RL) methods---in particular, least-squares policy iteration (LSPI)---for the problem of learning exercise policies for American options. We develop finite-time bounds on the performance of the policy obtained with LSPI and compare LSPI and the fitted Q-iteration algorithm (FQI) with the Longstaff-Schwartz method (LSM), the standard least-squares Monte Carlo algorithm from the finance community. Our empirical results show that the exercise policies discovered by LSPI and FQI gain larger payoffs than those discovered by LSM, on both real and synthetic data. Furthermore, we find that for all methods the policies learned from real data generally gain similar payoffs to the policies learned from simulated data. Our work shows that solution methods developed in machine learning can advance the state-of-the-art in an important and challenging application area, while demonstrating that computational finance remains a promising area for future applications of machine learning methods.},

	Abstract = {Sutton, Szepesvari and Maei (2009) recently introduced the first temporal-difference learning algorithm compatible with both linear function approximation and off-policy training, and whose complexity scales only linearly in the size of the function approximator. Although their gradient temporal difference (GTD) algorithm converges reliably, it can be very slow compared to conventional linear TD (on on-policy problems where TD is convergent), calling into question its practical utility. In this paper we introduce two new related algorithms with better convergence rates. The first algorithm, GTD2, is derived and proved convergent just as GTD was, but uses a different objective function and converges significantly faster (but still not as fast as conventional TD). The second new algorithm, linear TD with gradient correction, or TDC, uses the same update rule as conventional TD except for an additional term which is initially zero. In our experiments on small test problems and in a Computer Go application with a million features, the learning rate of this algorithm was comparable to that of conventional TD. This algorithm appears to extend linear TD to off-policy learning with no penalty in performance while only doubling computational requirements.},

	Abstract = {We introduce the first temporal-difference learning algorithms that converge with smooth value function approximators, such as neural networks. Conventional temporal-difference (TD) methods, such as TD(lambda), Q-learning and Sarsa have been used successfully with function approximation in many applications. However, it is well known that off-policy sampling, as well as non-linear function approximation, can cause these algorithms to become unstable (i.e., the parameters of the approximator may diverge). Sutton et al (2009a,b) solved the problem of off-policy learning with linear TD algorithms by introducing a new objective function, related to the Bellman-error, and algorithms that perform stochastic gradient-descent on this function. In this paper, we generalize their work to non-linear function approximation. We present a Bellman error objective function and two gradient-descent TD algorithms that optimize it. We prove the asymptotic almost-sure convergence of both algorithms for any finite Markov decision process and any smooth value function approximator, under usual stochastic approximation conditions. The computational complexity per iteration scales linearly with the number of parameters of the approximator. The algorithms are incremental and are guaranteed to converge to locally optimal solutions.},

The decision maker can select which option to generate the next observation from, the goal being to produce estimates with equally good precision for all the options. If sample means are used to estimate the unknown values then the optimal solution, assuming that the distributions are known up to a shift, is to sample from each distribution proportional to its variance. No information other than the distributions' variances is needed to calculate the optimal solution. In this paper we propose an incremental algorithm that asymptotically achieves the same loss as an optimal rule. We prove that the excess loss su ered by this algorithm, apart from logarithmic factors, scales as n^(-3/2), which we conjecture to be the optimal rate. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated on a simple problem.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the problem of learning the transition dynamics of deterministic, discrete-state environments. We assume that an agent exploring such an environment is able to perform actions (from a finite set of actions) in the environment and to sense the state changes. The question investigated is whether the agent can learn the dynamics without visiting all states. Such a goal is unrealistic in general, hence we assume that the environment has structural properties an agent might exploit. In particular, we assume that the set of all action sequences forms an algebraic group. We introduce a learning model in different variants and study under which circumstances the corresponding ``group structured environments'' can be learned efficiently by experimenting with group generators (actions). It turns out that for some classes of such environments the choice of actions given to the agent determines if efficient learning is possible. Negative results are presented, even without efficiency constraints, for rather general classes of groups, showing that even with group structure, learning an environment from partial information is far from trivial. However, positive results for special subclasses of Abelian groups turn out to be a good starting point for the design of efficient learning algorithms based on structured representations.},

Our algorithm, Greedy-GQ, is an extension of recent work on gradient temporal-difference learning, which has hitherto been restricted to a prediction (policy evaluation) setting, to a control setting in which the target policy is greedy with respect to a linear approximation to the optimal action-value function. A limitation of our control setting is that we require the behavior policy to be stationary. We call this setting latent learning because the optimal policy, though learned, is not manifest in behavior.

Strangely enough, current theoretical results for model-based algorithms do not support this claim: In a Markov decision process with N states, the best bounds on the number of exploratory steps necessary are of order O(N^2 log N), in contrast to the O(N log N) bound available for the model-free, delayed Q-learning algorithm. In this paper we show that a modified version of the Rmax algorithm needs to make at most O(N log N) exploratory steps. This matches the lower bound up to logarithmic factors, as well as the upper bound of the state-of-the-art model-free algorithm, while our new bound improves the dependence on the discount factor gamma. },

@article{NeuSz09:IRLParsing,
	Abstract = {One major idea in structured prediction is to assume that the predictor computes its output by finding the maximum of a score function. The training of such a predictor can then be cast as the problem of finding weights of the score function so that the output of the predictor on the inputs matches the corresponding structured labels on the training set. A similar problem is studied in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) where one is given an environment and a set of trajectories and the problem is to find a reward function such that an agent acting optimally with respect to the reward function would follow trajectories that match those in the training set. In this paper we show how IRL algorithms can be applied to structured prediction, in particular to parser training. We present a number of recent incremental IRL algorithms in a unified framework and map them to parser training algorithms. This allows us to recover some existing parser training algorithms, as well as to obtain a new one. The resulting algorithms are compared in terms of their sensitivity to the choice of various parameters and generalization ability on the Penn Treebank WSJ corpus. },

@book{Hutter:04uaibook,
	_Series = {EATCS},
	Abstract = {This book presents sequential decision theory from a
                  novel algorithmic information theory perspective. While the former
                  theory is suited for active agents in known environments, the
                  latter is suited for passive prediction of unknown environments.
                  The book introduces these two well-known but very different ideas
                  and removes the limitations by unifying them to one parameter-free
                  theory of an optimal reinforcement learning agent interacting with
                  an arbitrary unknown world. Most if not all AI problems can easily
                  be formulated within this theory, which reduces the conceptual
                  problems to pure computational ones. Considered problem classes
                  include sequence prediction, strategic games, function
                  minimization, reinforcement and supervised learning. Formal
                  definitions of intelligence order relations, the horizon problem
                  and relations to other approaches to AI are discussed. One
                  intention of this book is to excite a broader AI audience about
                  abstract algorithmic information theory concepts, and conversely
                  to inform theorists about exciting applications to AI.},

	Abstract = {We introduce the first temporal-difference learning algorithm that is stable with linear function approximation and off-policy training, for any finite Markov decision process, behavior policy, and target policy, and whose complexity scales linearly in the number of parameters. We consider an i.i.d. policy-evaluation setting in which the data need not come from on-policy experience. The gradient temporal-difference (GTD) algorithm estimates the expected update vector of the TD(0) algorithm and performs stochastic gradient descent on its L2 norm. We prove that this algorithm is stable and convergent under the usual stochastic approximation conditions to the same least-squares solution as found by the LSTD, but without LSTD's quadratic computational complexity. GTD is online and incremental, and does not involve multiplying by products of likelihood ratios as in importance-sampling methods.},

	Abstract = { For a discrete-time finite-state Markov chain, we develop an adaptive importance sampling scheme to estimate the expected total cost before hitting a set of terminal states. This scheme updates the change of measure at every transition using constant or decreasing step-size stochastic approximation. The updates are shown to concentrate asymptotically in a neighborhood of the desired zero variance estimator. Through simulation experiments on simple Markovian queues, we observe that the proposed technique performs very well in estimating performance measures related to rare events associated with queue lengths exceeding prescribed thresholds. We include performance comparisons of the proposed algorithm with existing adaptive importance sampling algorithms on a small example. We also discuss the extension of the technique to estimate the infinite horizon expected discounted cost and the expected average cost. },

	Abstract = {An analog system for fixed point computation is described. The system is derived from a continuous time analog of the classical over-relaxed fixed point iteration. The dynamical system is proved to converge for nonexpansive mappings under all p norms, p∈(1,∞). This extends previously established results to not necessarily differentiable maps which are nonexpansive under the ∞-norm. The system will always converge to a single fixed point in a connected set of fixed points. This allows the system to function as a complementary paradigm to energy minimization techniques for optimization in the analog domain. It is shown that the proposed technique is applicable to a large class of dynamic programming computations},

	Abstract = {In a companion paper [see ibid., vol. 44, p. 351-4, 1997] we presented theoretical analysis of an analog network for fixed-point computation. This paper applies these results to several applications from numerical analysis and combinatorial optimization, in particular: (1) solving systems of linear equations; (2) nonlinear programming; (3) dynamic programing; and (4) network flow computations. Schematic circuits are proposed for representative cases and implementation issues are discussed. Exponential convergence is established for a fixed-point computation that determines the stationary probability vector for a Markov chain. A fixed-point formulation of the single source shortest path problem (SPP) that will always converge to the exact shortest path is described. A proposed implementation, on a 2-μ complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process, for a fully connected eight-node network is described in detail. The accuracy and settling time issues associated with the proposed design approach are presented},

	Abstract = {Given a positive definite matrix M and an integer Nm ≥ 1, Oja's subspace algorithm will provide convergent estimates of the first Nm eigenvalues of M along with the corresponding eigenvectors. It is a common approach to principal component analysis. This paper introduces a normalized stochastic-approximation implementation of Oja's subspace algorithm, as well as new applications to the spectral decomposition of a reversible Markov chain. Stability and convergence are established under conditions far milder than assumed in previous work. Applications to graph clustering, Markov spectral decomposition, and multiplicative ergodic theory are surveyed, along with numerical results. },

	Abstract = {We discuss synchronous and asynchronous iterations of the form
xk+1 = x^k + \gamma(k) (h(x^k)+w^k), where h is a suitable map and {wk} is a deterministic or stochastic sequence satisfying suitable conditions. In particular, in the stochastic case, these are stochastic approximation iterations that can be analyzed using the ODE approach based either on Kushner and Clark's lemma for the synchronous case or on Borkar's theorem for the asynchronous case. However, the analysis requires that the iterates {xk} be bounded, a fact which is usually hard to prove. We develop a novel framework for proving boundedness in the deterministic framework, which is also applicable to the stochastic case when the deterministic hypotheses can be verified in the almost sure sense. This is based on scaling ideas and on the properties of Lyapunov functions. We then combine the boundedness property with Borkar's stability analysis of ODEs involving nonexpansive mappings to prove convergence (with probability 1 in the stochastic case). We also apply our convergence analysis to Q-learning algorithms for stochastic shortest path problems and are able to relax some of the assumptions of the currently available results.},

	Abstract = {Markov decision process (MDP) models are widely used for modeling sequential decision-making problems that arise in engineering, economics, computer science, and the social sciences. It is well-known that many real-world problems modeled by MDPs have huge state and/or action spaces, leading to the notorious curse of dimensionality that makes practical solution of the resulting models intractable. In other cases, the system of interest is complex enough that it is not feasible to specify some of the MDP model parameters explicitly, but simulation samples are readily available (e.g., for random transitions and costs). For these settings, various sampling and population-based numerical algorithms have been developed recently to overcome the difficulties of computing an optimal solution in terms of a policy and/or value function. Specific approaches include:
* multi-stage adaptive sampling;
* evolutionary policy iteration;
* evolutionary random policy search; and
* model reference adaptive search.
Simulation-based Algorithms for Markov Decision Processes brings this state-of-the-art research together for the first time and presents it in a manner that makes it accessible to researchers with varying interests and backgrounds. In addition to providing numerous specific algorithms, the exposition includes both illustrative numerical examples and rigorous theoretical convergence results. The algorithms developed and analyzed differ from the successful computational methods for solving MDPs based on neuro-dynamic programming or reinforcement learning and will complement work in those areas. Furthermore, the authors show how to combine the various algorithms introduced with approximate dynamic programming methods that reduce the size of the state space and ameliorate the effects of dimensionality.
The self-contained approach of this book will appeal not only to researchers in MDPs, stochastic modeling and control, and simulation but will be a valuable source of instruction and reference for students of control and operations research.},

	Abstract = {We consider a generalization of stochastic bandit problems where the set of arms, X, is allowed to be a generic topological space and the mean-payoff function is "locally Lipschitz" with respect to a dissimilarity function that is known to the decision maker. Under this condition we construct an arm selection policy whose regret improves upon previous results for a large class of problems. In particular, our results imply that if X is the unit hypercube in a Euclidean space and the mean-payoff function has a finite number of global maxima around which the behavior of the function is locally H{\"o}lder with a known exponent, then the expected regret is bounded up to a logarithmic factor by sqrt(n), i.e., the rate of the growth of the regret is independent of the dimension of the space. We also prove the minimax optimality of our algorithm for the class of problems considered. },

	Abstract = {The kernel function plays a central role in kernel methods. Most existing methods can only adapt the kernel parameters or the kernel matrix based on empirical data. Recently, Ong et al. introduced the method of hyperkernels which can be used to learn the kernel function directly in an inductive setting. However, the associated optimization problem is a semidefinite program (SDP), which is very computationally expensive, even with the recent advances in interior point methods. In this paper, we show that this learning problem can be equivalently reformulated as a second-order cone program (SOCP), which can then be solved more efficiently than SDPs. Comparison is also made with the kernel matrix learning method proposed by Lanckriet et al. Experimental results on both classification and regression problems, with toy and real-world data sets, show that our proposed SOCP formulation has significant speedup over the original SDP formulation. Moreover, it yields better generalization than Lanckriet et al.'s method, with a speed that is comparable, or sometimes even faster, than their quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) formulation.},

	Abstract = {It is shown that the normalized least mean square (NLMS) algorithm is a potentially faster converging algorithm compared to the LMS algorithm where the design of the adaptive filter is based on the usually quite limited knowledge of its input signal statistics. A very simple model for the input signal vectors that greatly simplifies analysis of the convergence behavior of the LMS and NLMS algorithms is proposed. Using this model, answers can be obtained to questions for which no answers are currently available using other (perhaps more realistic) models. Examples are given to illustrate that even quantitatively, the answers obtained can be good approximations. It is emphasized that the convergence of the NLMS algorithm can be speeded up significantly by employing a time-varying step size. The optimal step-size sequence can be specified a priori for the case of a white input signal with arbitrary distribution.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a simple and robust variable step-size normalized LMS (VSS-NLMS) adaptive algorithm is proposed. The NLMS algorithm with a fixed step-size usually results in a trade-off between the residual error and the convergence speed of the algorithm. The variable step-size NLMS algorithm presented here will eliminate much of this trade-off. The step-size variation makes it possible for the VSS-NLMS algorithm to converge faster and to a lower steady-state error than in the fixed step-size case. We derive here the proposed algorithm and analyze its steady-state performance. Computer simulation shows that the analytical results obtained in this paper are closely verified. In particular, our simulation results show that the proposed VSS-NLMS algorithm outperforms the traditional NLMS algorithm both in terms of convergence speed and steady-state error.},

	Abstract = {Nonlinear experiments involve response and regressors that are connected through a nonlinear regression-type structure. Examples of nonlinear models include standard nonlinear regression, logistic regression, probit regression. Poisson regression, gamma regression, inverse Gaussian regression, and so on. The Fisher information associated with a nonlinear experiment is typically a complex nonlinear function of the unknown parameter of interest. As a result, we face an awkward situation. Designing an efficient experiment will require knowledge of the parameter, but the purpose of the experiment is to generate data to yield parameter estimates! Our principal objective here is to investigate proper designing of nonlinear experiments that will let us construct efficient estimates of parameters. We focus our attention on a very general nonlinear setup that includes many models commonly encountered in practice. The experiments considered have two fundamental stages: a static design in the initial stage, followed by a fully adaptive sequential stage in which the design points are chosen sequentially, exploiting a D-optimality criterion and using parameter estimates based on available data. We explore the behavior of the maximum likelihood estimate when observations are generated from such an experiment. Two major technical hurdles are (1) the dependent nature of the data obtained from an adaptive sequential experiment and (2) the randomness in the total Fisher information associated with the experiment. Our analysis exploits a martingale structure rooted in the likelihood. We derive sufficient conditions that will ensure convergence of the chosen design to a D-optimal one as the number of trials grows. Besides ensuring the large sample optimality of the design, the convergence of the average Fisher information provides an ergodicity condition related to the growth of the martingale processes intrinsically associated with the likelihood. This key observation eventually yields the first-order efficiency of the maximum likelihood estimate via martingale central limit theorem and confirms the asymptotic validity of statistical inference based on the likelihood.},

	Abstract = {For many types of machine learning algorithms, one can compute the statistically `optimal' way to select training data. In this paper, we review how optimal data selection techniques have been used with feedforward neural networks. We then show how the same principles may be used to select data for two alternative, statistically-based learning architectures: mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression. While the techniques for neural networks are computationally expensive and approximate, the techniques for mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression are both efficient and accurate. Empirically, we observe that the optimality criterion sharply decreases the number of training examples the learner needs in order to achieve good performance.},

@article{EtoJou07,
	Abstract = { In this paper, we propose a stratified sampling algorithm in which the random drawings made in the strata to compute the expectation of interest are also used to adaptively modify the proportion of further drawings in each stratum. These proportions converge to the optimal allocation in terms of variance reduction and our stratified estimator is asymptotically normal with asymptotic variance equal to the minimal one. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of our algorithm. For the pricing of arithmetic average Asian options in the Black and Scholes model, the variance is divided by a factor going from 1.1 to 50.4 (depending on the option type and the moneyness) in comparison with the standard allocation procedure, while the increase in computation time does not overcome 1%.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we provide generalization bounds for semiparametric regression with the so-called partially linear models where the regression function is written as the sum of a linear parametric and a nonlinear, non- parametric function, the latter taken from a some set H with finite entropy-integral. The problem is technically challenging because the parametric part is unconstrained and the model is underdetermined, while the response is allowed to be unbounded with subgaussian tails. Under natural regularity conditions, we bound the generalization error as a function of the Rademacher complexity of H and that of the linear model. Our main tool is a ratio-type concentration inequality for increments of empirical processes, based on which we are able to give an exponential tail bound on the size of the parametric component. We also provide a comparison to alternatives of this technique and discuss why and when the un-constrained parametric part in the model may cause a problem in terms of the expected risk. We also explain by means of a specific example why this problem cannot be detected using the results of classical asymptotic analysis often seen in the statistics literature.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of finding a near-optimal policy in a continuous space, discounted Markovian Decision Problem (MDP) by employing value-function-based methods when only a single trajectory of a fixed policy is available as the input. We study a policy-iteration algorithm where the iterates are obtained via empirical risk minimization with a risk function that penalizes high magnitudes of the Bellman-residual. Our main result is a finite-sample, high-probability bound on the performance of the computed policy that depends on the mixing rate of the trajectory, the capacity of the function set as measured by a novel capacity concept (the VC-crossing dimension), the approximation power of the function set and the controllability properties of the MDP. Moreover, we prove that when a linear parameterization is used the new algorithm is equivalent to Least-Squares Policy Iteration. To the best of our knowledge this is the first theoretical result for off-policy control learning over continuous state-spaces using a single trajectory.},
